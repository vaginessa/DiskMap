# DiskMap
DiskMap bringing you an overall view of your disk and allows you to delete your *own* files (pictures, videos, musics...) as well as cache files. To do that, DiskMap is based on a interactive map of all the files and folders contained in your disk. The bigger a file is on the screen, the bigger it is on the disk.
